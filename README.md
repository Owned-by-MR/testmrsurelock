# What and how can I use it?

npm install in backend and frontend

backend: node server.js
frontend: npm run dev

open port accordingly, update ports used for backend if needed or frontend, used vite, tailwind could be added too if needed 

You can do all areas according to requirements with mobile style added.

PS your API has not been updating data, I added it differently. There is also code in comments left and env for api_key

Thanks.
