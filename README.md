# What and how can I use it?

npm install in backend and frontend

P.S.
You need to install after clone express in backend:
'npm install express'
in frontend instal vite:
'npm install vite'

backend: node server.js
frontend: npm run dev

open port accordingly, update ports used for backend if needed or frontend, used vite, tailwind could be added too if needed 

You can do all areas according to requirements with mobile style added.

Thanks.
